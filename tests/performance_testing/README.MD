##Performance Testing using JMeter

**Performance testing:** is crucial to determine that the web application under test will satisfy high load requirements. It can be used to analyze overall server performance under heavy load.

**Load Testing:** Modeling the expected usage by simulating multiple user access the web services concurrently.

**Stress Testing:** Every web server has a maximum load capacity. When the load goes beyond the limit, the web server start responding slowly and produce errors. The purpose of the stress testing is to find the maximum load the web server can handle.
